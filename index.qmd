title: "About Me: Professionally Speaking"
---
I'm Jack, a senior Computer Science major at Macalester College. I love to code and I care about the quality of the code I write. I'm looking to work on a team of developers who are serious about software done well. I will be available this summer, after I graduate in May 2024. 

I am also passionate about my Chinese studies and will graduate double majored in Chinese. I have spent the past two years conducting research on Chinese migrant worker poetry with the support of the Mellon Mays foundation.

**Chinese Language and Culture**: I am fluent in Mandarin and have studied in Taiwan and mainland China. With the Mellon-Mays Fellowship I continue to research and translate Chinese migrant worker poetry with the hope of publishing my work in Spring 2024.

### The Usual CS Coursework

Core Concepts in CS, Object Oriented Programming, Data Structures, Computer Systems, Software Development, Discrete Mathematics, Algorithm Design / Analysis, Parallel Programming and Intro to AI.

### My coding Ethics/ Attitude

Enabling the team: When I write my code, I pay attention to who may need to read and understand my code, considering how I can provide psuedo-code and friendly variable names to make my code easy for others to utilize. I highly value communication with project mates. 

Testing: When I build software, I think about the correctness of the code and I generate unit tests as I go to make the code resilient to future changes.
