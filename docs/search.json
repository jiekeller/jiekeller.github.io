Handled pretty much all of the code writing, most of the difficulty in this project came from understanding how and what tools to use for BERT and Word2Vec.

    "text": "I’m Jack, recent graduate Software Engineer working on the on-premises migration integration team at CNA Insurance. I love to code and I care about the quality of the code I write. I’m looking to work on a team of developers who are serious about software done well.\nI am also passionate about my Chinese studies and graduated with a double major in Chinese and CS. I spent the last two years of college conducting research on Chinese migrant worker poetry with the support of the Mellon Mays foundation.\n\nQualifications\n\nLanguages (Ordered)\n\nStrong\nJava: Java Standard Library, data structures  Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib\n\n\nDecent\nJS: Game systems, Phaser3  C: For dedicated parallel programming\n\n\n\nTOOLS USED (ACADEMICALLY)\nVSCode, PyCharm, Google Colab, Git, Linux/Bash\n\n\nTOOLS USED (PROFESSIONALLY)\nGuidewire, Gosu, Integration Gateway, Postman, DataDog, Git\n\n\nMy Interests / Academic Experience\nMachine Learning: Applying learning models to a large-corpus of data such as random forest, gradient-boost, ADAboost. Experience with libraries such as SKLearn, Tensor-Flow, PyTorch and BERT.\n\n\n\nDecision Tree Model with scikit-learn\n\n\nArtificial Intelligence: Experience with Microsoft Autogen, experimenting with multiple AI agents. Applying three agent, group-chat dynamic to a conversation on NBA player value.\nParallel Programming: OpenMP / MPI / OpenACC parallezing in C using gcc and pgcc compilers.\n\n\n\nTesting Data from Examining Different Scalability in Conway’s Game of Life\n\n\nChinese Language and Culture: I am fluent in Mandarin and have studied in Taiwan and mainland China. With the Mellon-Mays Fellowship I researched and translated 50 Chinese migrant worker poems and presented on this work as an undergrad student.\n\n\nThe Usual CS Coursework\nCore Concepts in CS, Object Oriented Programming, Data Structures, Computer Systems, Software Development, Discrete Mathematics, Algorithm Design / Analysis, Parallel Programming and Intro to AI.\n\n\nMy coding Ethics/ Attitude\nEnabling the team: When I write my code, I pay attention to who may need to read and understand my code, considering how I can provide psuedo-code and friendly variable names to make my code easy for others to utilize. I highly value communication with project mates.\nTesting: When I build software, I think about the correctness of the code and I generate unit tests as I go to make the code resilient to future changes. As I have entered the professional world of coding, I especially like to emphasize this for scalability and efficiency.\n\n\nContact Card"
