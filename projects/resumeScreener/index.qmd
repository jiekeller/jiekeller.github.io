Examined many interesting vectorization methods like scikit-learn, BERT, and Word2Vec. Handled pretty much all of the code writing, most of the difficulty in this project came from understanding how and what tools to use for BERT and Word2Vec. Completed for a 2023 fall capstone project, pdf of paper will be provided soon!
